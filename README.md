# WELCOME TO BIRDIES üê¶

## Context

In the University of Washington‚Äôs social environment, many students face challenges in finding a sense of belonging, especially with the university‚Äôs reputation as a ‚Äúcommuter school.‚Äù While academic success is often a key aspect of collegiate life, social integration plays an equally crucial role in student mental health, retention, and overall satisfaction. We have noticed that there is a lack of platforms that foster connections based on shared interests. As a result, we are hoping to bridge students together based on the shared interest of music, whether it‚Äôs joining a band, or just being able to find a community to have jam sessions with. There isn't much research specific to our problem space of music extracurriculars, but related research and studies conducted from other universities can be applied to our area. 

## Our Mission

Our team's mission and main problem space is to reduce barriers to participation in the University of Washington‚Äôs music community by creating a platform that makes it easier for students to discover music-related events, connect with others who share similar interests, and foster a sense of belonging through collaborative music experiences. We aim to enhance social integration, mental well-being, and overall student satisfaction by building a space where students can easily find and engage with music communities, whether through joining bands, attending jam sessions, or participating in other music-related activities.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

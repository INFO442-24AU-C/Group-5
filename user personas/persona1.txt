Music for a Cause
RSO

About:
Name: Music for a Cause
About: Perform to underprivileged people (homeless people, shelters, nursing homes, hospitals, etc.) to spread joy through music.

Bio:
The Music for a Cause RSO at the University of Washington has just been booked to play for the local nursing home but needs two clarinet players and a violin player. They’re asking around and posting things up on their facebook but they can’t seem to reach an audience outside of the individuals who follow them.

Frustrations:
Is not able to reach new students
Can’t fill the roles they need in time

Goals:
The Music for a Cause wants to be able to recruit new students who may not know about their RSO, and reach a larger audience. They want to also be able to connect with students to showcase new events that they are hosting or a part of.

Bio

Julia is a 20 year old sophomore at the University of Washington majoring in Informatics. She has a pretty scattered class schedule so she’s looking for a way to connect with other musicians on her time. In her free time, she likes to play the guitar at home and post music covers online.

Frustrations

Has class when her club is meeting
Doesn’t know when there are events going on
Has no friends to play music with her

Goals

Julia wishes to finally be in the know of music events happening right in UW. She wants to be able to find events that are happening when she has time and to be able to create her own events to meet like minded musicians.
